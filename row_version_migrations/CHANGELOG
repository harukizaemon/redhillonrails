[REVISION 20081204]

[FIXED] Still adding row_version columns in some cases.

[REVISION 20081102]

[NEW] Don't add columns when the table has no id. In this case, it's most likely to be a join table. You can always add :row_version = true to force it.

[REVISION 20071128]

[CHANGED] Add behaviour to ActiveRecord::Migration rather than SchemaStatements. Not only is this more appropriate but it doesn't suffer from being accidentally overwritten by a connection adapter.

[REVISION 20071128]

[FIXED] Workaround to ensure plugin is only ever loaded once.

[REVISION 20061202]

[CHANGED] Use Rails 1.2 alias_method_chain.

[CHANGED] Separate modules into individual files.

[REVISION 20061013]

[NEW] install.rb informs user of missing dependencies.

[REVISION 20060909]

[CHANGED] Replaced dependence on defunct Schema Defining plugin with one on RedHill on Rails Core.

[REVISION 200606004]

[FIXED] Don't add row version columns when ActiveRecord::Schema.define is running.

[CHANGED] This plugin now depends on Schema Defining!

[REVISION 20060602]

[NEW] Initial version.
