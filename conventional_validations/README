= Conventional Validations

Conventional Validations is a plugin that attempts to apply validation based on the
naming of columns. Specifically, the plugin searches for validation methods such that a
column named +foo+ or ending in +_foo+ would be validated using a method named
+validates_foo+.

For example, by defining a class method as:

  def self.validates_phone(*attr_names)
    validates_format_of attr_names, :with => /[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*/, :allow_nil => true 
  end

Any columns named +phone+ or ending in +_phone+ would be automatically validated.
