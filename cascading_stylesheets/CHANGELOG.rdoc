== 2.0.1 release 2009-01-14

* Changed package structure.

== 2.0.0 release 2009-01-05

* Brought up-to-date with Rails 2.2.
* No longer uses :defaults. Instead use :cascades.
* No longer supports loading defaults (application.css and #{RAILS_ENV}.css). These can just as easily be applied using stylesheet_link_tag RAILS_ENV.

== 2007-11-28

* Workaround to ensure plugin is only ever loaded once.

== 2007-03-15

* Use ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper::STYLESHEETS_DIR when searching for stylseheets.
* Override expand_stylesheet_sources instead of stylesheet_link_tag.

== 2007-02-14

* option to have stylesheets named for layouts added just after the RAILS_ENV stylesheet. Layouts are looked for in stylesheets/layouts/layout_name.css.

== 2006-12-02

* Use Rails 1.2 alias_method_chain.
* Separate modules into individual files.

== 2006-07-26

* First attempt at supporting paths for modules. Ie. an action of A::B::C#action would check for: a.css; a/b.css; a/b/c.css; and finally a/b/c/action.css.

== 2006-07-17

* Placed code into module named after the class to which the mixin will be applied.
