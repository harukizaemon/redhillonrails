= Acts As Teapot

Acts As Teapot is a Ruby on Rails plugin that ensures your Ruby on Rails applications conform to
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2324.txt. Our assumption here is that your application is not a coffee
pot and does not understand the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0). Thus, if ever a BREW request or any
other request with the Content-Type set to "application/coffee-pot-command" is received, the server will respond with
418 Iâ€™m a teapot. 

== Installation

You have two choices for installation. The first uses a gem (recommended):

  config.gem "harukizaemon-acts_as_teapot", :lib => "acts_as_teapot", :source => "http://gems.github.com"

Or you can use the Rails plugin

  $ ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/harukizaemon/acts_as_teapot.git
